# Scanner for MRZ, QR codes, barcodes and document scanning with text recognition

## Scanbot SDK example app for Xamarin

This example app demonstrates how to integrate the Scanbot SDK for Xamarin.


## What is Scanbot SDK
The Scanbot SDK brings scanning and document creation capabilities to your mobile apps. It contains modules which are individually licensable as license packages. For more details visit our website https://scanbot.io

The Scanbot SDK for Xamarin is available as a universal NuGet package for Android and iOS:
[ScanbotSDK.Xamarin](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScanbotSDK.Xamarin)


## Requirements
[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) with [Xamarin Platform](https://www.xamarin.com)
(For iOS Visual Studio for Mac **7.4+**)


## Documentation
The documentation of the current Scanbot SDK Xamarin release can be found here: [https://scanbotsdk.github.io/documentation/xamarin/](https://scanbotsdk.github.io/documentation/xamarin/)


## Please note

The Scanbot SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!

After the trial period has expired all Scanbot SDK functions as well as the UI components (like Document Scanner UI) will stop working or may be terminated.
You have to restart the app to get another trial period.

To get an unrestricted, "no-strings-attached" 30-day trial license, please submit the [Trial License Form](https://scanbot.io/en/sdk/demo/trial) on our website.
